# INSURANCE-RISK-AND-CLAIMS-ANALYSIS-
Project Overview This project analyzes historical insurance policy data to identify key risk factors and predict claim frequency/severity. By leveraging exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling, the goal is to help insurance providers optimize premium pricing and identify high-risk segments.
Key Objectives:
Risk Segmentation: Identifying demographic and behavioral traits that lead to higher claim costs.
Loss Ratio Analysis: Calculating the relationship between premiums earned and claims paid.
Predictive Modeling: Building a model to estimate the probability of a claim being filed based on policyholder attributes.

Business Impact In the insurance industry, profitability relies on the "Loss Ratio." This project focuses on lowering that ratio by:
Early Warning: Detecting patterns in "Frequency" (how often claims happen) and "Severity" (how expensive they are).
Pricing Optimization: Highlighting segments where premiums may be underpriced relative to their risk profile.
